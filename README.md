# sql-exploratory-data-analysis-project

This repository contains a collection of SQL scripts demonstrating various analytical techniques, such as changes over time, cumulative, performance, data segmentation, part-to-whole analysis. 

This project was a part of [SQL Full Course for Beginners (30 Hours) â€“ From Zero to Hero](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSKVgrwhzus) by [Data with Baraa](https://www.youtube.com/@DataWithBaraa). I completed this course to uphold my skills and to learn a more about SQL.
